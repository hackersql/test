XMLmao Challenge 1 - Retrieve ALL the Nodes!
======================
In SQL injection, the UNION keyword joins the output of SELECT queries into one result set. The equivalent in XPath is the pipe character. If X and Y are queries, we can say that X | Y returns the results of X along with the results of Y. If we want to return every node in an XML dataset, the query would be:

/*

Our injection needs to turn both the first and second halves of the query into complete and syntactically correct XPath queries which return no data, and join their results with a query for all nodes in the database. If the query looks like this:

/xmlfile/users/user[username='OUR_INPUT']/username

We must complete both the portion before our input:

/xmlfile/users/user[username='

We can do this with the string a'] which makes the first query in the set look this:

/xmlfile/users/user[username='a']

We also need to complete the portion after our input:

']/username

It's important to note that invalid node names don't result in query failure, they just return no results. So, we can use the prefix /a['a to turn the portion after our input into the following query:

/a['a']/username

Now all we need to do is join both queries with our all-nodes query using pipes, which looks like |/*| when you put it together. All in all, our resulting query will look like this:

/xmlfile/users/user[username='a']|/*|/a['a']

So, a correct answer to challenge 1 is:

a']|/*|/a['a
