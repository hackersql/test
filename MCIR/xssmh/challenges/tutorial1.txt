XSSmh - Challenge 1 - The Failure of Quote Filters
---------------
In this challenge, you must write a script into the resulting HTML which does not use single or double quotes.

There are several ways to achieve this, one of the simplest is using regular expressions and the "source" property.

<script>alert(/hello/.source)</script>

Another variation uses the "String.fromCharCode" method. This is slightly more complex, but has the advantage that you don't need your string to be a valid regular expression and is thus more flexible. This involves converting your string into a series of bytes in ASCII decimal representation. For instance, the decimal value of 'h' is 104. The same alert box could be built using the following syntax:

<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(104,101,108,108,111))</script>
